# Foreword

I am putting this out there primarily as a resource for my own students to help them through the installation and provide written instruction for the computational tools we use in the courses I teach. As such, I will initially focus on R and RStudio, but I will probably add tools (e.g., reference managers, github, make) over time as I have time. (Note: If you want to contribute to this, create a Pull Request or [send me an email](mailto: zief0002@umn.edu).) Also, feel free to offer criticism, suggestion, and feedback. You can either [open an issue](https://github.com/zief0002/modeling/issues) on the book's github page or [send me an email](mailto: zief0002@umn.edu) directly.
